# Land of Hop, v6

Beer catalogue with beverages I have drunk last few years. This is my playground to test some technologies and, above all, a place where I can prove that it is possible to build quite big application which is highly performant, scalable, has good accessibility etc.

This is the sixth version of the application. In short previous versions were different in terms of stack:

1. React with Create React App
2. React with Gatsby
3. Svelte with Sapper
4. React with Next
5. Svelte with SvelteKit

This 6th version is still Svelte and SvelteKit. I am very happy with this set, but I would like to start over because the whole app needs a UI refactor. I decided to rebuild the page with TailwindCSS. I can do that based on the previous version, but I believe building an app from scratch is a good idea. I can fix most of the legacy code in the meantime.
